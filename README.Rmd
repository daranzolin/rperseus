## Goal

The goal of `rperseus` is to furnish classicists, textual critics, and R enthusiasts with texts from the Classical World. While the English translations of most texts are available through `gutenbergr`, `rperseus`returns these works in their original language--Greek and Latin.

## Description

`rperseus` provides access to classical texts within the [Perseus Digital Library's](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/) CapiTainS environment. A wealth of Greek and Latin texts are available, from Homer to Cicero to Boetheius. The Perseus Digital Library includes English translations in some cases. The base API url is `http://cts.perseids.org/api/cts`. 

## Installation

`rperseus` is not on CRAN, but can be installed via:

```{r eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("daranzolin/rperseus")
```

## Usage

[See the vignette to get started.](https://daranzolin.github.io/rperseus//articles/rperseus-vignette.html)

To obtain a particular text, you must first know its full Uniform Resource Name (URN). URNs can be perused in the `perseus_catalog`, a data frame lazily loaded into the package. For example, say I want a copy of Virgil's *Aeneid*:

```{r warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(purrr)
library(rperseus)

aeneid_latin <- perseus_catalog %>% 
  filter(group_name == "Virgil",
         label == "Aeneid",
         language == "lat") %>% 
  pull(urn) %>% 
  get_perseus_text()
```

You can also request an English translation for some texts:

```{r eval = FALSE}
aeneid_english <- perseus_catalog %>% 
  filter(group_name == "Virgil",
         label == "Aeneid",
         language == "eng") %>% 
  pull(urn) %>% 
  get_perseus_text()
```

Refer to the language variable in `perseus_catalog` for translation availability.

## tidyverse and tidytext 

`rperseus` plays well with the `tidyverse` and `tidytext`. Here I obtain all of Plato's works that have English translations available:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(purrr)
plato <- perseus_catalog %>% 
  filter(group_name == "Plato",
         language == "eng") %>% 
  pull(urn) %>% 
  map_df(get_perseus_text)
```

And here's how to retrieve the Greek text from Sophocles' underrated *Philoctetes* before unleashing the `tidytext` toolkit:

```{r}
library(tidytext)

philoctetes <- perseus_catalog %>% 
  filter(group_name == "Sophocles",
         label == "Philoctetes",
         language == "grc") %>% 
  pull(urn) %>%
  get_perseus_text()

philoctetes %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

While there's no obvious way to filter out the Greek stop words and prepositions, or recognize the various moods and tenses of Greek verbs, the text is ripe for analysis!
